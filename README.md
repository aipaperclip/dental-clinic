# WEB INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FOR A DENTAL PRACTICE

## User functionalities

In order for a user to schedule treatment, he must be first registered as a patient.
Once the user registers, he becomes a patient and gets his number of cartons.
On the appointment page, the patient can schedule treatment depending on the choice of services, dentists and time. After choosing a service, we will be able to select only dentists who are expert in this service. And after that, we will be able to choose only the time and the day when the dentist works.

-	Scheduling appointments
-	Cancelling appointments ( + giving reasons )
-	View all appointments (scheduled, finished, cancelled)
-	The ability to add comments after the completed treatment

## Dentist functionalities

There are two types of dentists. The main dentist and an ordinary dentist. The main dentist has additional options, such as insight into the treatments of all dentists, adding a new dentist, changing the working time (adding, deleting, updating), changing the time to cancel the treatment.
